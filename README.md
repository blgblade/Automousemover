Auto Mouse Mover

Hey Everyone, 

i was tired after i see that murgee.com/auto-mouse-mover/ is only shareware
... pay for a software that moves the mouse wtf ?
there is also a good freeware tool @msstore move mouse...
for my usecase on a very low powered laptop it has 20% cpu usage...hell no -_-

side note: i'm not a programmer, its just a little bit google and little bit vb.net

i build my own tool that does the job.
it only needs net framework 4 (that should be installed everywhere )
